<p>The "N", "E", "S", and "W" are directions (north, south, east, west). The numbers are the different hall numbers. The blue line is the false wall. The exclamation mark is where the Fate Changer spell and the Artifact is.</p>
<p>The code determines what directions you can go, and what happens when you go down those directions, based on what the current mazeLoc is, which also directly correlates to hall number, exluding mazeLoc = 0, which is the big room at the start.</p>
<p>ex. at mazeLoc 1, south takes you to the big room, west takes you to mazeLoc 2, and east injures you.</p>
<p>The reason why directions are flipped is because I forgot to account for the fact that the character in-story is going south while the maze exit was at the top, which would typicaly be seen as north, and I didn't realize that just flipping the maze upside-down was an option until after I finished the maze :|.</p>
