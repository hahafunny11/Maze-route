<p>The "N", "E", "S", and "W" are directions. The numbers are the different hall numbers. The blue line is the false wall. The exclamation mark is where the Fate Changer spell and the Artifact is.</p>
<p>The code determines what directions you can go, and what happens when you go down those directions, based on what the current mazeLoc is, which also directly correlates to hall number, exluding mazeLoc = 0, which is the big room at the start.</p>
